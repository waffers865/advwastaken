      Some of the things I don't like about you~ you're accepting friend requests and I'm accepting sponsorship requests, there is a difference sis, BUILD SOME DAMN STANDARDS. Don't really be like a normal person, you're my sis, shoulda prove it tho.<br/><br/>
      Bruh, I can't really get you out of my mind, sis. You're literally one of my life's most trustable and favourite person. I won't hurt your feelings however how much you do to mine. <br/>
I'm a boy I'm used to getting my feelings hurt, but you're different, I was once again treating you as a boy, you need to understand I've no experience talking to, ughhhhh, {"<"}you know this word{">"} You hate me? I don't really care, I'm gonna treat you the same way I've ever done, my sis, by my heart. Sorry, for my all misdeed. Thank you for everything you've done for me. <br/>
Fun fact: I knew you won't login into my account ever, I've never changed it's password. I mean you're my sis, really. <br/>
Bruh, that day, I turned around my head, saw you literally in my hairstyle (my dream person~ people of my mindset, to whom I could talk till eternity), smiling, one of the best moments of my life, my sister (why do I feel like I'm saying a movie dialogue).
Look, if you promise me to never talk about marriage and all (you literally deleted your 400 followers account just for me, I know it must've take a lot of courage, just one more thing PLEASE, and here goes a 5K+ member discord servers head mod requesting you), I'll literally talk, play with you IRL, but I think I may be different IRL, won't talk this much. <br/>
Nah, sorry I can't build your WebApp because of some discord things, forgive me for that. I realised me running away from you does nothing more than to hurt you more, so, FROM NOW ON WHENEVER I SEE YOU, I'LL HAVE A SMILE IN MY FACE?
