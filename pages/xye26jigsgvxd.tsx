      You're the first person who made me cry, and feel ignored. Congratulations ðŸŽ‰, there are somethings you're gonna get in return for that too. Breaking all bonds with you no matter what you're to me. OK, joking again? It's funny ðŸ˜‚. Let's see if it's a joke and YOU HOPE IT WAS JUST A JOKE. Your WebApp was on update v0.7 and I really just don't care about it anymore. <br/>
I realised you're coming between me and my academical life. There are only some stuffs in between if anyone comes, no matter whoever they're, I'm breaking all bonds whatsoever. You came in between me and my C.S life. I just don't care about you anymore. Yes it's me, I wear muffer all around my head, no virtual person knows about my irl activities except ppl like you. Anyways got my sponsorship money, you may find me in/around Katras-Bazar nowadays. Saionara.
