     <p className="bg-white text-zinc-800 p-2">Okay, so I've no idea of what you're thinking right now, but here, I CAN SHARE WITH YOU MY DEEPEST THINGS, MAIN EMAIL'S PASSWORD, BUT NOT HERE, I'M PERHAPS BEING WATCHED (AND I DON'T THINK YOU'D LIKE ME GETTING AWAY FROM MY WORKS WORTH IN YEARS). If you think I'm joking then see the time I left my ordinary life, joined darkweb, joined darknitro, organized dark coffee, a group with international peoples [45 members] (although 4 Indians). Now that's something you'd never get to know unless by me. I need to act just like an ordinary person that's why I have accounts on fb.</p>
     <p className="bg-violet-400 p-2">You did selected me from millions, but the same also goes here. If I select something then it's selected forever, no way someone's ever getting in between us, just don't believe any third person ever.</p>
      <p className="bg-violet-400 p-2">I'm going back to my world, class 12th basically all about electricity (my love). Just as the way we were before I got to know you're here. So, if I get my mind into something I usually try to complete with all of my mind (you must've known till now, I hate theories (C.S, Physics, Chemistry), love practicals).</p>
      <p className="bg-violet-400 p-2">So, just 1 year from now on (actually lesser), don't be on insta anymore, I know thousands of distractions are on it's way, but you know, although I was the one to distract farthest, I actually didn't do it intentionally. Hope you forgive me. About me? You're my favourite as always. I promise meeting you after we get into our dream lives. If you ever had any true feelings for me, you're going to open a "free-hospital" for poor peoples. You know if god gives 1000 distractions, he might send one motivation, and I want to be the one to raise you, not be the reason for your downfall (so it now becomes your responsibility too).</p>
      <p className="bg-violet-400 p-2">I can't really get to know what's on your mind, mate. There's no way I can bypass private insta acc, you may have to make your account public to tell your thoughts. Last day, tell all of your thoughts. If you ever feel I'm fading away, it's just an illusion or just your dream. Falling, Sunflower, Mood~ Spotify songs that define my feelings for ya. We are from different cultures, religions but we're humans anyways. Because of your somewhat good body, there might be a misconception that I'm here for your body, that's not the case, your soul is something really special to/for me (yes something anyone would've said but where's the proof? If I had that feelings for you from the start, I'd have never gone harsh on you whatsoever).</p>
    <p className="bg-violet-400 p-2"><br/><br/>I accept you the way you really are, and yeah, focus on your inborn skill, even if it's not tech, I love peoples who build up their skills. You seem to not realise how common it is nowadays to have things like this for someone, and this surely puts us in the category of 3rd class peoples. You don't know how bad it hurts when you get hot plastic spilled over your hands, but it's going to hurt even more if you ever turn up against me. </p>
