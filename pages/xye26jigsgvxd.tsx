      You're the first person who made me cry, and feel ignored. Congratulations ðŸŽ‰, there are somethings you're gonna get in return for that too. Breaking all bonds with you no matter what you're to me. OK, joking again? It's funny ðŸ˜‚. Let's see if it's a joke and YOU HOPE IT WAS JUST A JOKE. Your WebApp was on update v0.7 and I really just don't care about it anymore. <br/>
I realised you're coming between me and my academical life. There are only some stuffs in between if anyone comes, no matter whoever they're, I'm breaking all bonds whatsoever. You came in between me and my C.S life. I just don't care about you anymore. Yes it's me, I wear muffer all around my head, no virtual person knows about my irl activities except ppl like you. Anyways got my sponsorship money, you may find me in/around Katras-Bazar nowadays. Enjoy with your new friends and let me enjoy with my new team Squad909, JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.
<br/> You literally thought I'd say worldwide lectures for you? Like I'm going to die for you or things like that? I already told you "You dragged me into a field I've never been before", YOU LITERALLY DRAGGED ME FROM THE SPOTIFY SONG "ALL I WANT IS YOU" TO "MISS YOU". <br/>
Good luck finding a better person than me. <br/>
Last day of 11th, I thought of talking to you irl, but couldn't find you although I was waiting for someone else too. Yeah that's what your and my god decided, I'm never talking to 3 DAVIANS, you know the first one, along with two who have the same mindset towards me. <br/>
Thanks for making me cry fifth time. THAT'S NOT WHAT REAL FRIENDS DO.<br/><br/>
