        Presenting you, <a className="text-blue-700 underline" href="https://waffers865.github.io/dav-ss/">https://waffers865.github.io/dav-ss/ </a>
      , as your birthday gift from your brother. I've focused on speed rather than design for now. Currently, it's version 0.3, I guranttee till v1.0, it'd get stable from UI to security, everything.
Don't tell anyone I made this. Instead tell I (you) made this, to compete with ADV or something. <br/>
 And yeah, make your account public, talk to me with indications, I'm feeling like I'm getting ignored, if I take it seriously, then you already know what all things I can do. <br/>
However, there are a little things that if I ever get to know then I'd have to break our friendship instantly without even a double thought, if I ever get to know you're telling anyone else about my personal or virtual life, then no matter what you're to me, I'll have to break our friendship.
